<h2><i>ADDRESS</i></h2> </center>

<p align="justify">Encouraged by the kind welcome which greeted their former efforts to
provide a volume worthy the attention of the ladies of the United
Kingdom, the Publishers of the <i>Lady's Album of Fancy-Work</i> have issued
a similar production for 1850. Solicitous to preserve the favourable
consideration so flatteringly accorded, every care has been taken to
render the <i>Lady's Album of fancy-Work</i> for 1850 as attractive and
useful as possible; no expense has been spared in its artistic
illustration, letterpress, and embellishment; and it will be found an
elegant ornament in the drawing-room as well as a useful ally at the
work-table. The patterns and designs are of the most useful and varied
character: specimens are given of each style of work recently invented;
and no article either of ornament or use at present in fashion is
omitted.</p>

<p align="justify">The exercise of the needle has been from time immemorial a favourite
occupation with the females of every country; and the allusions to the
subject from cotemporary historians and poets evince that this feminine
pursuit was regarded with approval and respect. The invention of
embroidery is ascribed to the Phrygians; and we also learn from ancient
authors, that the Sidonians particularly excelled in this beautiful art
of decorative needlework; it must have also made considerable progress
in the country soon after the Norman Conquest, from the accounts that
are recorded of the robes embroidered in gold and silver, generally worn
by persons of rank at that period. The Bayeux Tapestry also remains to
us as a lasting trophy of the skill and industry of Queen Matilda and
the ladies of her court, and is not more interesting as a historical
record than as a specimen of the needlework of the medi&aelig;val age. The
introduction of knitting into this country is comparatively of modern
date; so late as the middle of the sixteenth century. The invention of
the art is usually ascribed to the Spaniards; though the Scotch, with
some appearance of justice, assert their claims as its originators. Like
all inventions, knitting has undergone wonderful improvements since it
was first simply used for stocking-making: and the value attached to
stockings so made may be judged from the fact, that a pair were deemed a
fitting present from one sovereign to another. A pair of knitted hose
was amongst the gifts received by that lover of finery, Queen Elizabeth;
but no record remains to shew if these were preserved with the three
thousand robes which were found after her death in the wardrobe of
England's Maiden Queen.</p>

<p align="justify">The love for domestic occupations, which is so admirable a trait in the
character of our countrywomen, has often been a subject of gratulation;
and that female ingenuity and skill may continue to be employed in
embellishing the drawing-room, rather than in directing the political
intrigues of the <i>salon</i>, must be desired by all interested in the
preservation of those domestic attributes which give so pleasing a charm
to home, and secure the comfort of all around.</p>

<p align="justify">The taste which her Majesty Queen Victoria evinces for feminine pursuits
and occupations has naturally exercised considerable influence in
preserving habits of industry amongst her female subjects; and to her
Majesty's example, and that of the amiable Queen Dowager, may be
ascribed that the labours of the English embroideress are now justly
appreciated, and her work esteemed as in no respects inferior to the
produce of foreign ingenuity.</p>

<p align="justify">In expressing their thanks for the patronage extended to the <i>Lady's
Album of Fancy-Work</i> for 1849, the Publishers take leave to state that
the present Volume contains designs and patterns for various articles in
Embroidery, Braid-Work, Crochet, Knitting, Netting, Ribbon-Work,
Scagliola, and Indian Ornamental Work; all of which are executed and
engraved in a style of unusual superiority. Each pattern is accompanied
with plain and explicit directions; and it is hoped that their execution
will afford many hours of pleasurable employment to the fair and
industrious votaress of the needle.</p>

<p align="justify">CHAIN-STITCH OPEN CROCHET.&mdash;This consists of five or any uneven number
of loops attached by a plain stitch to every third stitch of the
foundation, and in the succeeding rows to the centre loop of the chain
of previous row.</p>

<p align="justify">THREE CHAIN CROCHET.&mdash;Work a chain of three loops as in chain-stitch
open crochet.</p>

<p align="justify">DOUBLE CROCHET.&mdash;Work as follows: having made a chain, pass the needle
through the first loop on the chain, draw the cotton through the loop,
there will now be two loops on the needle, through these draw the
cotton.</p>

<p align="justify">SINGLE CROCHET.&mdash;Insert the needle in the loops, and draw the cotton
through this loop and that on the needle.</p>

<p align="justify">RIBBED CROCHET.&mdash;This is worked in a similar manner to double crochet,
only that the under loop of the previous row is taken, and it is done in
rows to and fro.</p>

<p align="justify">LONG STITCH.&mdash;Twist the cotton round the needle, pass it through the
loop, draw the cotton through the first two loops on the needle, then
catch the cotton again and draw it through the next two loops; there
will be one loop left on the needle.</p>

<p align="justify">DOUBLE LONG STITCH.&mdash;This resembles long stitch, excepting that the
cotton is twisted twice round the needle.</p>

<p align="justify">TREBLE LONG STITCH.&mdash;Twist the cotton three times round the needle.</p>

<p align="justify">SINGLE OPEN CROCHET.&mdash;This is a succession of long stitches, with a
chain-stitch between each, missing one stitch of the foundation; in the
succeeding rows the long stitch is worked between the two long stitches
of the preceding rows.</p>

<p align="justify">DOUBLE OPEN CROCHET.&mdash;This consists of two long stitches, then two
chain-stitches; or it may be varied by making one long stitch, two
chain-stitches, missing the same number of stitches in foundation as
there are chain-stitches.</p>

<p align="justify">TREBLE OPEN CROCHET.&mdash;Work three long stitches, then three chain,
missing three of the foundation.</p>

<p align="justify">VANDYKE OPEN CROCHET.&mdash;Work three long stitches into one of the
foundation, make one chain-stitch, miss three of the foundation; repeat.
In the next and following rows the long stitches are worked in the
chain-stitch.</p>

<p align="justify">The various elegant designs for handkerchiefs, jupons, shirts, &amp;c. are
worked in raised satin stitch. The material used is French
working-cotton; numbers 100 or 120 will be found suitable for most
purposes, but this must be regulated by the quality of the cambric.
Handkerchiefs embroidered in colours continue to be extremely
fashionable; the patterns in the <i>Lady's Album</i> are of the most novel
description, and quite suitable for this style of work. The names and
initial letters are worked in satin-stitch, sewing over the lines.</p><br /><br /><br />

thistles with the blue-greens, the stems with brown, the thistle and bud
of thistle with the shades of puce, working the centre of the former
with the shades of scarlet.</p>

<p align="justify">Work the rose on the right hand of thistle with the four darkest shades
of crimson, and that on the left and the buds with the four lightest
shades. Work the remaining rose with the yellow shades. Work the designs
for corners in a similar manner, shading according to the taste of the
worker.</p>

<p align="justify">The above design is adapted for the front or door of a small rosewood or
an inlaid ebony cabinet, suitable for a lady's boudoir or dressing-room.
It looks well if worked upon white instead of black satin; and if the
former is used, it is advisable to have plate-glass as a protection to
the needlework.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Flowers for the Collar.</i></p>

<p align="justify">&mdash; Make a chain of 6 stitches; close it by taking a plain stitch in the
first of the chain; work in every loop of this small ring 2 long
stitches, with a chain-stitch between each of the long ones. In
finishing the round, make a stitch to complete the number of twenty-five
loops; then <i>(a)</i> work 5 plain stitches, and in the fifth make a chain
of 7 stitches; turn, work 6 stitches in double crochet along the chain,
and 1 plain in the loop from which the chain springs; repeat from <i>(a)</i>
four times. You have then three veins; work round them as directed for
the leaves of the edging; after the second row of double crochet break
off your cotton. According to the size of the collar, five or six
flowers will be sufficient, if you make also the trifoliums.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Trifoliums</i>.&mdash;Make a chain of 18 stitches; turn, and work along the
chain 3 plain stitches, a vein of 7 stitches; 6 plain, a vein of 8
stitches; 6 more plain stitches, another vein of 7; 3 plain stitches,
and break off the cotton. Begin at the first end, and work the two rows
of long stitches exactly as directed for the leaves of the edging; at
the end of the two following rows, which are in double crochet, round
the leaves, instead of breaking off the cotton, work in double crochet
from the third leaflet to the first; thus connecting the work in one
single leaf with three divisions. Having prepared the required number of
flowers and leaves, baste your edging on the paper pattern, so that the
whole of the leaves rest on the paper; then work a chain rather loose,
to connect the two ends of the collar on the neck side; turn, and work
along that chain a row of double crochet. Baste this narrow band
carefully half an inch from the edge of the paper; then begin a row of
double crochet inside the collar, throwing, at even distances, a
slanting chain from the edging to the neckband, working back each time
along that chain in long or double crochet; repeat the same operation
from the neckband to the edging, so as to divide the whole middle of the
collar in a certain number of diamonds; baste the diamonds to the paper,
place alternately in each a flower or a trifolium, and, with a
sewing-needle and fine French embroidery cotton, connect the flowers and
leaves to the inside edges of the diamonds in long twisted stitches,
rows of button-hole stitches, or any kind of lace-work. After being
washed and starched, the collar ought to be pressed on the wrong side
with the head of a round nail warmed in the fire.</p>

<p align="justify">30. A CHESS-BOARD(<i>SCAGLIOLA WORK</i>.)</p>

<p align="justify">This description of drawing is called Scagliola work, or a Mischia
(mixed workmanship); it was first invented by Guido Tassi, and the art
was afterwards improved and perfected by Henry Hugford, a monk, of
Vallambrosa. It was first used to counterfeit marbles; and the altar of
St. Antonio, in the church of St. Nicolo, at Carpi, is still preserved
as a monument of extraordinary skill and beauty. It consists of two
columns, representing porphyry, and adorned with a pallium, embroidered
as it were with lace; while it is ornamented in the margin with medals
bearing beautiful figures.</p>

<p align="justify">The dicromi, or yellow figures on a black ground, in imitation of the
Etruscan vases, are now most admired in scagliola work; and as the art
is one easy of attainment, we shall describe it. Having procured a piece
of sycamore of the desired size and shape, you draw upon it with a
pencil, first the centre piece, and afterwards the border; you then
trace over the pencil marks with Indian-ink and a fine crow-quill, and
next fill in the ground with Indian-ink and a camel's-hair brush. After
two or three days, varnish with the best picture-varnish. If sycamore
cannot be procured, deal will answer the purpose, covered with good
cream-coloured drawing-paper.</p>

<i>Directions for making up the collar</i>.&mdash;After the leaves, flowers,
band, and border are worked, cut the shape of the collar in pink or blue
paper; gum a piece of holland at the back of the paper, to prevent its
tearing; tack the border on the paper pattern, the right side downwards;
then sew on the sprigs as in the engraving. Sew the edges of the leaves
and flowers nicely, to prevent their turning up; then, with a
sewing-needle and fine cotton, unite the flowers, leaves, and borders,
by passing the needle from one part of a leaf or flower to another four
or five times; then pass the needle under the bars formed six or eight
times, according to the length of the bar; pass the needle to another
part, and continue to connect the work in this manner throughout the
collar.</p>

<a name="69_SCREEN_INDIAN_ORNAMENTAL_WORK"></a><h2>69. SCREEN. (<i>INDIAN ORNAMENTAL WORK</i>.)</h2>
</center>
<p align="justify">Beautiful cabinets, work-boxes, work-tables, fire-screens, &amp;c., may be
painted in imitation of ebony inlaid with ivory by the following
means:&mdash;Let your screen be made of an elegant form, but merely of common
white wood or deal, prepared as below.</p>
<br />

<p align="justify"><i>Composition for the Surface of Wood</i>.&mdash;Steep one ounce of glue in a
pint of cold water all night; throw off the water in the morning. Take
six ounces of finest white lead in powder, mix it by degrees in a
mortar, with about half a pint of cold water, till it is perfectly
smooth, then place it, along with the glue, in a clean pan. Add half a
pint more water; set it on the fire, stirring constantly till it boils.
Let it boil three minutes; take it off, and pour it into a stone jar,
and continue to stir it occasionally till cold. When cold, but before it
congeals, take a clean paint-brush, and paint your screen with the
composition. When it is quite dry, rub it over with sand-paper, to make
it quite smooth; then give it another coat of the white composition,
repeating the rubbing with sand-paper as before. Repeat this same
process five or six times, until you obtain a smooth, equal, white
surface. When that is accomplished, dissolve the fourth of an ounce of
isinglass in a quarter of a pint of water; when cold, but liquid, give
the screen a coat of it with a clean brush, and do not use the
sand-paper after it.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>To Ornament the Screen</i>.&mdash;Lay a sheet of black tracing-paper on the
screen, with the black side downwards; then place a pattern above it,
with the right side uppermost; place a weight here and there, to prevent
it slipping; then trace over the outline with a rather blunt stiletto.
On removing the paper, you will find the outline of the pattern
transferred to the surface of the screen. Trace over the outline,
and shade, in lines, with a fine camel's-hair pencil dipped in Newman's
lamp-black; fill in with the same.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Varnish</i>.&mdash;Place four ounces of rectified spirit of wine in a
wide-mouthed bottle; add one ounce of gum sandarac, a quarter of an
ounce of gum mastic, and a drachm of camphor, all in powder. Put a
stopper in the bottle, set it near a fire, and shake it occasionally.
When all the gums are quite dissolved, add one ounce of oil of
turpentine; then strain through muslin into another clean, dry
wide-mouthed bottle. Let it stand a day or two before using.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Mode of Varnishing</i>.&mdash;Take a large clean new varnish-brush, dip it into
the bottle, and then cover over all your screen with it. When perfectly
dry, give it another coat, and so on till it has had six coats; let it
remain untouched for two days; rub it smooth with sand-paper; then give
it two more coats of varnish, and repeat the rubbing, being careful to
wait between each coat till the last is dry, and not to rub with
sand-paper sooner than two days after varnishing, and never give more
than two coats of varnish in a day&mdash;one in the morning, another at
night. When you think it looks clear and sufficiently thick, give it
another coat without using the sand-paper after it; let it stand four
days; then rub it all over with pounded rottenstone, and wipe it off
with a wet cloth; after which take a little Florence oil and
hair-powder, and polish with your hand.</p>

knit and pearl in alternate rows, making a stitch at the beginning of
every row, until you have fourteen or sixteen stitches; then knit and
pearl six rows alternately, without increase, and continue in knitted
and pearled rows, decreasing one stitch at the beginning of each row,
till six or eight stitches alone remain; these cast off in the plain
row, taking the two last as one before you turn the last stitch over.
Two petals like these are required.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Large Yellow Petal</i>.&mdash;Take a bright, though rather deep, shade of
yellow wool, split; cast on three stitches, knit and pearl in alternate
rows, increasing one stitch before and one after the middle stitch in
the plain row, till you have fifteen or seventeen stitches; take a
higher shade of yellow, and work six more alternate plain and pearled
rows, still increasing in the middle, but decreasing one stitch at the
beginning of every row; change your wool for a deep violet, and continue
to knit in alternate plain and pearled rows, decreasing one stitch at
the beginning of each row, till seven stitches only remain; these cast
off, taking the two last as one.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Two smaller Petals</i>.&mdash;Exactly like the large one, but increased only to
thirteen stitches. Sew a fine wire round each petal with split wool, tie
the five petals together with a bit of green.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Buds</i>.&mdash;Take eight or ten lengths of split wool, yellow and violet,
place across a piece of wire, fold the wire, twist the ends, turn down
the ends of wool, tie them round the wire, leaving out the length
required for the bud (about a quarter of an inch); cover the stem with
green wool, split; also the stem of the heartsease.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Leaves</i>.&mdash;Begin with a shade of green wool, split as for one of the
yellow petals, but you have thirteen stitches; cast off three at the
beginning of the two following rows, go on increasing again to thirteen;
cast off three at each end, and make thus as many scallops as will look
well&mdash;in general three or four on each side make a very good-sized leaf;
after the last scallops, decrease one stitch at the beginning of every
row, till the leaf comes to a point.</p>

fourth shade of blue, fourth ditto of green, fourth ditto of peach
Berlin wool; amber floss silk, six skeins of each of the wools, and a
similar quantity of silk will be required; also a piece of fine
piping-cord, and emerald-green velvet ribbon.</i></p>
<br />

<p align="justify">Cut the canvass into strips 3 inches in width, and the length required;
sew 14 lengths of cord upon the canvass, leaving 2 threads between each
cord; the cord will cover a space of 2 threads. Leave a margin 18
threads from this, and with black work 6 stitches over the 7th and 8th
cords opposite each other; with blue work 6 stitches on the same cords
on the right side, and with green 6 on the left; with peach work 6
stitches on the 9th and 10th cords, above the stitches of black; and
with scarlet 6 stitches on the 6th and 7th cords, underneath the black.
There will now be 60 stitches worked. With white work 6 stitches on a
line with each of the preceding stitches, and on the 2 cords above the
stitches of peach and below the scarlet; with amber silk work 6 stitches
in the same manner. This completes the first diamond. The pattern is
repeated to the end of row. The spaces between the diamonds are worked
as follows: With black work 6 stitches on a line with each stitch of
amber; with peach work the stitches between the black on the 3d and 4th
cords; on the right hand work 6 stitches with blue on the 1st and 2d
cords, and on the left with green; work the centre stitches with silk.
The opposite space is worked in a similar manner, substituting scarlet
for peach. For a cushion it will be necessary to work 4 strips of this
pattern; and, in making it up, a length of velvet ribbon of a similar
width is placed between each division of work. Finish with green cord
and tassels.</p>

more leaves exactly the same, opposite the points of all the large
centre leaves. Then two more leaves opposite each of the d c rings
inside the open rounds (which will be at an equal distance on each side

two, the upper point of each leaf to be turned <i>outwards</i>, and to be
tacked with needle and thread to the point of the next leaf, which it

Sixteen of these sprigs are required, and sixteen more small roses.
Place one sprig between each of the chains of 24 d c, where they meet at
the points of the leaves, and sew them by the thread which was left at
the end of the stalk. Confine them to the 24 d c by the lower 13 c s.
Place a small rose between each of these sprigs, fastening them together
where they meet. The best way is, to cut out a circle in coloured paper,
and (after the crochet work is completed) place the mat wrong side up
upon it, and fasten the flowers to it and to each other, as it will then
be quite flat and smooth.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://gutenberg.net/etext06/">http://gutenberg.net/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
